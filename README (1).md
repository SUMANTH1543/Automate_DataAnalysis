## Automated Data Analysis Web Application using Streamlit
Project Overview
This project is a Streamlit-based web application that automates data analysis tasks for uploaded datasets. The application provides users with an interactive interface for conducting univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis on their datasets. It supports data visualization, summary statistics, and correlation analysis, making it a powerful tool for quick insights.

## Features
# 1. Data Upload and Loading
Supports .csv and .xlsx file formats.
Automatically detects and separates categorical and numerical columns.
# 2. Data Summary
Display dataset shape and sample data (head()).
Show basic summary statistics (describe()).
Display missing value counts for each column.
# 3. Univariate Analysis
Numerical Data: Histogram and box plots.
Categorical Data: Frequency count bar charts.
# 4. Bivariate Analysis
Numerical-Numerical: Scatter plots for visualizing relationships.
Categorical-Numerical: Box plots for comparative analysis.
# 5. Multivariate Analysis
Pair plots for identifying relationships between multiple numerical features.
Correlation heatmap with interactive color scale.
# 6. Interactive Plots
Dynamic chart selection for line charts, bar charts, and histograms.
Choose columns to visualize relationships between specific features.
